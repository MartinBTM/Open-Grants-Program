## Project OverviewÂ ðŸ“„

**Bycoin Wallet is a cross-chain Android and iOS wallet ,support BTC, ETH,LTC, BTM, USDT,USDC.**


Bytom blockchain aims to useassettokenization to disrupt financial systems.By atomizing and liquefyingassets,theycanbesecurelycreated and circulatefreelywithin Bytom andotherblockchains. To that end, Bytom has created many comprehensive products: Secured PoW Bytom mainchain, High speed DPoS Vapor sidechain and Crosschain gateway tech that supports multi-blockchain interactions.

Currently the DeFi Protocol - MOV has been running on Vapor sidechainand has rankedamongst theTop 10 DEX trading volumesacrossall DEXs.

Bycoin Wallet is a cross chain Mobile walletthatnot only supports Bytom's products, but also enables access to many blockchainsvia itscross-chaingateway.Bycoin wallet already supports BTC, ETH, BTM, USDT,USDC and LTC, and has successfully brought these assets into the DeFi sphere.

We will create a polkadot node and build a complete set of Polkadot account systems to supportthePolkadotnetworkanditsecosystemassets. At the same time, we will support the cross-chaininteroperabilityof Polkadotwiththe Bytom chain through gateways that willenable our userstoseamlesslyparticipate inthePolkadotecosystem.

Polkadot will build a big asset ecosystem. For wallets, various tokens can be integrated more conveniently. Currently, when we do cross-chain, we need to develop different gateways for each chain, and after implementing Polkadot Parachain, we can directly use the Token in the Polkadot ecology


Relevant statistics of Bycoin:

Number of active addresses: 58080

Number of transactions: 98970032

Number of transactions in 24 hours: 259236

## Development RoadmapÂ ðŸ”©

### System Components

 ![](https://uploader.shimo.im/f/qVVwHDUd4jVcndLf.png!thumbnail)

Bycoin will build and operate Polkadot node, and at the same time encapsulate related functions into services for wallet use. Because Bycoin is a light wallet, some information needs to be stored through the Server, but key information such as keys will remain in the userâ€™s mobile phone. We will open a cross-chain gateway to make Polkadot an anchored asset on Bytom, which will make it more convenient for ecological users to use and pave the way for subsequent planning.
